# Introduction

This is a application for friends to share some ideas and book some activities together.

# Why

I made this application to grow my skills in sveltekit and docker environment.

# Installation

```bash

git clone
cd WOTW
cd app
npm install
cd ..
docker-compose up-d
    
```

For the development environment, you need to install dependencies on your local machine, cause the docker-compose file binds the app folder to the container.
